# Bone marrow dickkopf-1 links hematopoiesis deregulation to neurovascular impairments in ischemic stroke - GitHub repository

This repository accompanies the article "Bone marrow dickkopf-1 links hematopoiesis deregulation to neurovascular impairments in ischemic stroke". The `neurobehavioral for WT/DOX and DKK1/ON.html, neurobehavioral for chDKK1/OFF and chDKK1/ON.html, point pattern analyses for WT/DOX and DKK1/ON.html, and point pattern analyses for chDKK1/ON and chDKK1/OFF.html` contains a rendered Quarto notebook (https://quarto.org/) with R code for the analysis of neurobehavioral data and point patterns. The `RNAseq.html` contains a rendered markdown notebook with R code for the analysis of bulk mRNA sequencing of contralateral (intact) and ipsilateral (lesion) hemispheres following experimental ischemic stroke in mice. The "KEGG pathway analysis of DI/WI.html, KEGG pathway analysis of WI/WC.html, KEGG pathway analysis of WC/WI.html, KEGG pathway analysis of DI/DC.html, KEGG pathway analysis of DC/WC.html and KEGG pathway analysis of WC/DC.html" contain the KEGG pathway analyses of bulk RNA sequencing of contralateral (intact) and ipsilateral (lesion) hemisphere following ischemic stroke in mice.
